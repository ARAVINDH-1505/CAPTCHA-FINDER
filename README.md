## Features
- **CAPTCHA Generation**: Creates random CAPTCHAs using text, images, or mathematical problems.
- **CAPTCHA Validation**: Verifies user input against the generated CAPTCHA.
- **Multiple CAPTCHA Types**: Supports text-based, image-based, and audio CAPTCHAs.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Adjust CAPTCHA complexity based on security needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be embedded in web applications with minimal setup.
